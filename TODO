TODO
study, like at least a bit pls
refactor code
epic effects (particles) when a large portion of velocity was preserved when entering hook
investigate weird vibration if you just hang on the hook for a while
fix fucking NaN crashes when chilling on hook for too long
setup git
lock hook to center of tile
movement:
-adjust jump: switch onKeyJustPressed and add a small buffer for when almost touching the ground
-adjust hook analogously
-hook settings: snapping to nearest 30/45 deg? setting hook points with click and using with space or using in current pos with just mouse?
-make colliding while inHook force hook exit (PROPERLY)
